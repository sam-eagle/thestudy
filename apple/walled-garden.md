# Walled Garden
Intially an Apple ID (aka account) was meant for free services such as
* Mail
* Notes
* Calendar
* Safari (bookmarks or favourites)
To synchronize a single users information across their own devices
* e.g. sync my notes from my phone to my computer.

# Expanded to Family
Fast forward to the current technological environment and users "want it all".  They want to now share more than "mine to mine" but with close friends or children or partners.   Apple introduces "Family" sharing which is useful, but NOT all items are shareable or follow the same rules for outside of the "garden".
